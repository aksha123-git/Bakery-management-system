# Bakery-management-system
A Bakery Management System is a software application designed to help bakery owners and staff manage various aspects of their bakery business. This system typically includes functionalities for inventory management, sales tracking, customer management, order processing, and more. In this example, I'll provide a high-level overview of how you can create a simple Bakery Management System using SQL and Python.

**Database Design (SQL):**

1. **Create a Database:** Start by creating a database to store all the necessary information. You can use a database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE BakeryManagement;
USE BakeryManagement;
```

2. **Create Tables:** Define the tables required for your system. Here are some example tables:

   - Customers
   - Products
   - Orders
   - Inventory
   - Sales

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    quantity INT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Inventory (
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
```

**Python Implementation:**

Now, you can create a Python application to interact with this database. You'll need a database library like `mysql-connector`, `psycopg2`, or `sqlite3`, depending on your chosen database system.

```python
import mysql.connector  # Import the appropriate library

# Connect to the database
db_connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="BakeryManagement"
)

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = db_connection.cursor()

# Implement functionalities such as adding customers, products, processing orders, managing inventory, and tracking sales using SQL queries executed through Python.

# Example: Adding a customer
def add_customer(name, email, phone_number):
    sql = "INSERT INTO Customers (name, email, phone_number) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
    val = (name, email, phone_number)
    cursor.execute(sql, val)
    db_connection.commit()

# Example: Processing an order
def process_order(customer_id, order_date, total_amount):
    sql = "INSERT INTO Orders (customer_id, order_date, total_amount) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
    val = (customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
    cursor.execute(sql, val)
    db_connection.commit()

# Implement similar functions for products, inventory, and sales management.

# Close the database connection when done
db_connection.close()
```

This is a simplified example of a Bakery Management System. Depending on your project's requirements, you can add more features, user interfaces, and error handling. Additionally, you may consider using a web framework like Flask or Django to create a user-friendly front-end for your application.
